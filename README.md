# HOW TO USE THIS SCRIPT
This script allow you to create some pairs "Donor-Receiver" for your Secret Santa. I added a little "mail sender" function that allow you to not know in advance these couples, and tell directly to each donor their receiver via email. You obviously need to know your friends email to use it :)
## GMail configuration:
Follow [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20221025065204/https://leimao.github.io/blog/2022-12-29-Python-Send-Gmail//) very useful guide. I didn't use its code, but mine works anyway
## Requirements:
No need to install libraries with pip. Script uses the pre-installed ones
