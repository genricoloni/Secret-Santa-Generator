# HOW TO USE THIS SCRIPT
This script allow you to create some pairs "Donor-Receiver" for your Secret Santa. I added a little "mail sender" function that allow you to not know in advance these couples, and tell directly to each donor their receiver via email. You obviously need to know your friends email to use it :)
## GMail configuration:
